# Polygon Tracer
This animation is a based off of Bees and Bombs twitter. This was created with the createJs library. This app creates a map or vertex for any sided polygon and then creates a dot to trace the outline of the shape. Speeds are based off of a rotations/time equation to ensure that the points will meet at their origins in a fixed time. 
## Getting Started 
The animation can be found in the root directory above with the title results.gif
